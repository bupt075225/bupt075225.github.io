>什么是容器镜像文件？

A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

容器镜像文件类似于虚拟机镜像文件，前者是用来运行一个软件，后者用来运行一台虚拟机。虚拟机镜像文件可以理解为物理主机的系统硬盘。

>什么是容器？

Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers images become containers when they run on Docker Engine.

同一个容器镜像文件，可以生成多个同时运行的容器。容器是应用软件的抽象，包含软件的打包和依赖；虚拟机是物理主机的抽象。

>什么是Docker Engine?

Docker Engine是业界事实上的容器运行时(container runtime)标准实现，它是运行容器的管理软件，类似于运行虚拟机所需要的qemu。

>容器的数据存储

>什么是微服务(Serverless)架构

Serverless refers to a cloud computing model whereby application developers don't have to provision servers or manage scaling for their app. Instead, those routine tasks are abstracted away by the cloud provider, allowing developers to push code to production much faster than in traditional models.

>什么是云原生应用(Cloud-native application)

A cloud-native application is an application built to take advantage of cloud computing models to increase speed, flexibility, and quality, while reducing deployment risks. 

Cloud-native approaches are similar to microservices architectures. However, although microservices can be one of the outcomes of building cloud-native applications, there are many steps to reach the level of maturity for managing microservices in production.

实现更高效的产品发布，提升开发与部署效率，提高生产力，快速解决BUG和满足用户需求，降低对用户体验的影响，会促进应用软件和商业模式的繁荣。

简单的说，是基于容器，微服务架构，持续集成和部署这一系列技术来实现云原生应用的开发、部署，但是要在生产环境中真正实现并极大地发挥出功效，并非简单的过程。



Containers and container orchestration technology abstract and simplify access to underlying infrastructure and provide robust application life-cycle management across various infrastructure environments, such as datacenters, private clouds, and public clouds. A container platform offers additional self-service, automation, and application life-cycle management capabilities. This model lets developers and operations teams spin up consistent environments quickly, helping developers focus on building applications without the obstacles and delays associated with provisioning infrastructure.
